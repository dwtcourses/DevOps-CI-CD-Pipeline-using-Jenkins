## Challanges faced

### Checkbox.io (Khelan - Pavithra)
- Figure out how to use vault to encrypt the DB passwords.
- Setting up mongoDB service and adding a user took us a lot of time.
- Since we were running playbook to deploy checkbox.io we later realized about setting up environment variables in virtual machine.

### iTrust2 (Khelan - Pavithra) 
- Learnt how to set up mysql-server without root password and make necessary changes in mysql.conf file to accept incoming connections.
- Learnt how to kill processes before deploying application again on EC2 instance (so that it doesn't give port binding error : Idempotency)
-
