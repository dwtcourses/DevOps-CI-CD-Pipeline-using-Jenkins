## Coverage/Jenkins Support

Ensure you have the ability to run iTrust's and checkbox.io* test suite. You need to have your build server have a jetty/mysql instance in order to properly run the unit + integration tests. Add a plugin to jenkins to measure coverage and display a report within Jenkins on every commit.
